⚖️ LexAI — Judicial Intelligence System
LexAI is a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) powered legal intelligence assistant designed to answer queries strictly based on statutory data from the Indian Motor Vehicles Act.

The system combines local Large Language Models with vector-based retrieval to deliver grounded, citation-safe legal responses without hallucinations.

🚀 Features
🔎 RAG-based Architecture (Retrieval + LLM grounding)
📚 Vector database powered by ChromaDB
🧠 Local LLM inference via Ollama (Gemma)
📄 Excel-based statutory ingestion pipeline
⚖️ Strict document-bound answering (no assumptions, no hallucinations)
🔒 Fully local and private execution
🎨 Premium Streamlit UI with judicial-themed design
🏗️ Architecture Overview
User Query ↓ Chroma Vector Store (Embeddings: mxbai-embed-large) ↓ Top-K Relevant Legal Sections ↓ Strict Grounded Prompt Template ↓ Gemma LLM (via Ollama) ↓ Final Answer (Statute-Only, No External Knowledge)

⚙️ Installation
1️⃣ Clone the Repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/lexai.git
cd lexai
2️⃣ Install Dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
3️⃣ Install Ollama & Required Models
Download Ollama from:
👉 https://ollama.com

Pull the required models:

ollama pull gemma3
ollama pull mxbai-embed-large
▶️ Running the Application
streamlit run main.py
The app will launch locally in your browser.

📊 Accuracy Evaluation
LexAI was evaluated using structured statutory queries covering:

Legal definitions

Penal provisions

Amendment references

Rule-making powers

Insurance and liability clauses

Observed Results
✅ High grounding reliability

✅ Accurate statutory quotations

✅ Correct fallback behavior when data is unavailable

Refer to LexAI_Accuracy_Report.txt for detailed evaluation metrics.

🧠 Hallucination Prevention Strategy
LexAI enforces a strict grounding protocol:

Answers must use only retrieved statutory records

External knowledge is explicitly disallowed

Mandatory fallback response:

"The data does not contain this information."

Additional safeguards include:

Context length control

Max Marginal Relevance (MMR) retrieval

Legal-domain optimized embeddings

🔐 Privacy & Security
🔒 100% local inference

🚫 No API calls

🌐 No external data transmission

💻 Fully offline capable

📈 Future Enhancements
Multi-Act support (IPC, CPC, CrPC)

Section-wise legal citation formatting

PDF ingestion pipeline

Legal citation confidence scoring

Hybrid search (BM25 + Vector embeddings)

Confidence estimation in responses

If you want, I can also:
- Optimize this for **GitHub stars & recruiters**
- Add **badges** (Python, Streamlit, Ollama, License)
- Write a **strong project description** for resumes / LinkedIn
- Create a **system design diagram image**

Just say the word 😄
